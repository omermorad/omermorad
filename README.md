## Hey There ðŸ‘‹

My name is Omer, a tech lead and backend maestro specializing in Node, TypeScript, and NestJS. Beyond coding, I love sharing my knowledge as a public speaker.
I'm on a relentless mission to push the boundaries of software engineering. Driven by this fervor, I created Automock, a clear reflection of my obsession for quality.
