## About
I usally work on distributed systems, developer workflows, and cloud-native architectures. I'm focusing on code integrity, automated testing, and processes that deliver maintainable, reliable systems.

As the creator of **[Suites](https://github.com/suites-dev/suites)**, a unit-testing framework, I champion strong testing practices.

## Focus
- **Testing & Quality** — DI-centric, type-safe testing for TypeScript/NestJS.
- **Developer Workflows** — CI/CD, release automation, artifact promotion, quality gates.
- **Distributed & Cloud-Native** — reliability patterns, tracing/metrics, pragmatic scalability.

## Selected Open Source Projects
- **Suites** — next-gen testing for TypeScript backends working with dependency injections
  → `suites-dev/suites`
- **nestjs-pact** — Pact modules for consumer/provider testing in NestJS.  
  → `pact-foundation/nestjs-pact`
