# Hi, I'm Omer Morad 👋

I'm a platform engineer specializing in TypeScript, NestJS, developer experience, and backend quality. I'm a strong believer in open source and the creator of a few projects.

Previously, I worked with companies like: [Vetric](https://vetric.io), [Incredibuild](https://incredibuild.com), [Harmonya](https://harmonya.com), [Balance](https://getbalance.com), [Cheq](https://cheq.ai) and [Natural Intelligence](https://naturalint.com).

Sometimes I [write things](https://omermorad.me/blog), mostly about TypeScript, NestJS, and developer experience.
